                        <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do

                            but

                <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
                    accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain
                    uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company
                    work, a
                    society work, a civilisation work.
